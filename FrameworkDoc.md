# Architectures of Advanced Agentic Systems: A Technical Blueprint

## Unifying Principles

Despite their differences, these four archetypes are unified by a set of modern engineering principles that are essential for building robust, production-ready agentic systems. Throughout this report, three cross-cutting themes will be explored:

- **The Standardized Communication Protocol Stack:** A detailed analysis of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for human interventions, the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) for structured collaboration, and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols for low-latency communication.
- **The Imperative of Adaptive Intelligence via Reinforcement Learning:** The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a mechanism for continuous system improvement, enabling agents to adapt to new patterns, optimize strategies, and learn from feedback.
- **The Non-Negotiable Requirement of Observability and Security in Production:** The fundamental integration of observability tools (OpenTelemetry), load testing (Locust), and security practices (GuardRails) as pillars of any reliable agentic architecture.

This document serves as a technical blueprint, providing the architectural details, design justifications, and implementation considerations required to build these advanced systems.

# Part I: The Stateful Auditor – A LangGraph Architecture for Financial Compliance

This chapter details a system where auditability and state management are paramount. The choice of LangGraph is deliberate, as its graph-based structure inherently creates a traceable and persistent record of the auditing process, a critical requirement in financial compliance.

## 1.1. System Architecture Overview

The architecture is designed for an end-to-end data flow, from document ingestion to report generation, ensuring transparency and control at every step.

### Architectural Diagram and Data Flow

The architecture consists of a frontend developed in TypeScript/React, a Python backend with FastAPI, a central orchestrator built with LangGraph, a set of specialized agents using PydanticAI to ensure data consistency, and data repositories in Redis for state checkpointing, along with a logging/tracing sink for observability via OpenTelemetry.

#### Data Flow Narrative

The process begins when a user, typically an auditor, uploads tax documents (e.g., invoice PDFs, bank statements in CSV) through the web interface. The FastAPI backend receives the files and initiates a new execution thread in LangGraph, assigning it a unique audit identifier. The graph orchestrates the workflow, passing the audit state through various agent nodes. At every significant step, the full graph state is persisted in Redis, creating a checkpoint. Real-time updates about audit progress are streamed back to the frontend via WebSockets. When the system encounters critical anomalies or decision points requiring human judgment, the graph pauses and triggers a prompt via MCP, awaiting auditor intervention.

## 1.2. The LangGraph Execution Core

LangGraph is not merely a workflow engine, but a state machine designed to build auditable and resilient agentic processes. Its graph-based architecture is ideal for modeling the non-linear, branching nature of a financial audit, where investigations may follow multiple paths depending on the evidence uncovered.

### Audit Graph Design

The graph is composed of nodes that represent distinct phases of the audit. Each node is a function or agent that receives the current state, performs a task, and returns an updated state.

- **Node START → ingest_and_parse:** Entry node that ingests raw documents. Uses libraries like PyMuPDF for text extraction and PydanticAI to parse and structure extracted data into predefined schemas (e.g., `Invoice`, `BalanceSheet`). The state is updated with the structured data.
- **Node ingest_and_parse → statistical_analysis:** A specialized agent applies Benford’s Law and Zipf’s Law to numerical data (e.g., invoice values, payments). These statistical laws are effective in detecting anomalies in large financial datasets. The agent calculates initial anomaly scores and adds them to the state.
- **Node statistical_analysis → regulatory_validation:** In parallel, another agent cross-checks transactions against a regulatory knowledge base (e.g., SOX, IFRS) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This agent verifies transaction compliance with known rules.
- **Node statistical_analysis → rl_anomaly_detection:** An agent leveraging a pre-trained reinforcement learning model to detect subtle, non-obvious anomalies that traditional statistical methods may miss.
- **Node consolidate_results:** A “sink” node aggregating the results of all parallel analysis branches. It consolidates risk scores, regulatory violations, and RL-detected anomalies into a single `findings` object in the graph state.
- **Node generate_report → END:** The final node generates a structured audit report, detailing all anomalies, their risk levels, and supporting evidence.

#### Conditional Edge Implementation for Dynamic Routing

The core intelligence of the audit lies in the graph’s ability to adapt dynamically. After `consolidate_results`, a conditional edge function evaluates an aggregated risk score calculated from the findings.

**Routing Logic:** The decision function, similar to `route_bc_or_cd` described in LangGraph’s documentation, inspects the state and determines the next step:

- If `risk_score > HIGH_THRESHOLD`, the flow is routed to `deep_dive_investigation`, which may involve extracting more data or running complex forensic analyses.
- If `risk_score > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD`, the flow is routed to `human_review_mcp`, pausing execution and requesting human auditor intervention.
- Otherwise, the flow proceeds to `generate_report`.

#### State Persistence with Redis Checkpointing

This is not just a fault-tolerance measure; it is a fundamental auditability requirement. Every state transition represents a verifiable step in the audit trail.

**Implementation:** The `langgraph-checkpoint-redis` library will be used to persist the full graph state at each step. The `RedisSaver` class will be configured to keep the complete history of each audit `thread_id`. This enables auditors to pause an analysis lasting several days, resume it later, or “replay” execution to a specific checkpoint to understand how a particular conclusion was reached. Persistence effectively transforms AI execution into an immutable ledger of its reasoning process.

## 1.3. Agent Specialization with PydanticAI

In multi-agent systems, unstructured data transfers are one of the main sources of failure. PydanticAI addresses this problem by enforcing strict data schemas, acting as a “data contract” between agents.

**Implementation:** Each agent’s (node’s) input and output will be defined by a Pydantic model. For example, the `ingest_and_parse` node will output a `List[InvoiceModel]`. The `statistical_analysis` agent will receive this list as input. PydanticAI leverages LLM function calling or tool calling to enforce JSON-structured outputs, which are subsequently validated. This guarantees that the statistical agent receives data in the exact expected format, eliminating runtime analysis errors and ensuring data flow integrity.

## 1.4. Adaptive Anomaly Detection with Reinforcement Learning

Traditional anomaly detection systems rely on static thresholds, which sophisticated fraudsters can bypass. Reinforcement Learning (RL) allows the system to continuously learn and adapt what constitutes a “suspicious” transaction based on auditor feedback.

**RL Problem Framing:**

- **State:** A vector representation of transaction features (e.g., amount, vendor, timestamp, statistical scores, expense category).
- **Action:** A discrete action space: `{FLAG, IGNORE}`.
- **Reward:** When an agent flags a transaction, it is shown to a human auditor via MCP. If confirmed as a true positive, the agent receives `+1` reward. If a false positive, it receives `−1`. If the agent ignores a transaction later identified as fraudulent (e.g., during manual review), it receives a heavy `−10` penalty.

**Stable-Baselines3 Integration:**

A pre-trained model from Stable-Baselines3 (e.g., DQN or PPO) will be used. The model will be integrated as a tool invoked by the `rl_anomaly_detection` agent. Auditor-provided feedback (rewards) will be used to periodically fine-tune the model online, allowing it to adapt to new fraud patterns over time. This hybrid intelligence—combining classical statistical methods (Benford’s Law) with adaptive RL—balances explainability with the ability to detect emerging threats.

## 1.5. Human Intervention and Security

**MCP for Critical Validation:**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) serves as the designated mechanism for human intervention. When a high-risk anomaly is detected or a conditional edge routes execution to human review, the graph pauses execution. It exposes a prompt via an MCP server. The human auditor, using an MCP client integrated into their dashboard, can then approve, reject, or comment on the finding. This human input updates the graph state before execution resumes, ensuring that critical decisions are always validated by a domain expert.

**GuardRails for Compliance:**

GuardRails AI will be implemented as a non-negotiable security layer.

- **Input GuardRail:** Before processing, documents will be scanned to detect and anonymize Personally Identifiable Information (PII), ensuring compliance with regulations like LGPD.
- **Output GuardRail:** Before the final report is generated, its contents will pass through a GuardRail check to ensure it contains no speculative language, does not violate SOX guidelines, and does not accidentally leak sensitive internal data.

## 1.6. Frontend and Real-Time Visualization

- **Tech Stack:** FastAPI backend, TypeScript/React frontend.
- **Real-Time Updates:** WebSockets will be used to stream LangGraph checkpoint state changes to the frontend. As each node completes, the user interface updates to display the current audit phase, any new findings, and the current risk score. This requires a WebSocket endpoint in FastAPI subscribed to a Redis Pub/Sub channel where LangGraph publishes state updates.
- **Interactive Visualization:** The D3.js library is chosen for its power in creating data-driven custom visualizations. It will be used to render a transaction graph where nodes represent entities (accounts, vendors) and edges represent transactions. Anomalous transactions identified by agents will be highlighted in real time, with edge thickness or color reflecting risk scores, providing an intuitive and immediate view of problem areas.

A final and crucial architectural note for this system is the deliberate omission of direct Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication. Although the broader requirement includes implementing A2A protocols, the core value of LangGraph in this auditing context is its centralized orchestration and step-by-step state management. Allowing agents to communicate directly via A2A would bypass the central graph, creating “off-the-record” interactions that would not be captured in state checkpoints. This would violate the fundamental principle of full auditability. Therefore, the correct architectural decision is to enforce that all agent communication is mediated through state updates within LangGraph, making the absence of A2A a deliberate and essential design choice for this specific use case.

# The Imperative of Observability and Reliability

For agentic systems to be production-ready, they must be observable, testable, and reliable.

- **OpenTelemetry:** The standard for generating traces, metrics, and logs. In a multi-agent system, distributed tracing is essential for debugging, enabling engineers to follow a single request as it flows across multiple agents and tools.
- **Locust:** The tool for performance and load testing. It is critical for understanding how the system behaves under pressure, especially for HFT and Medical systems.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):** The practice of automating tests and deployments, ensuring that changes to one agent do not break the entire ecosystem.
